## Credits:

The implementation inspired by https://github.com/ysmood/nisp[NISP], which does the similar thing in JS. In addition to what 
is supported in NISP, `j-s-exp` provides the support for context, which helps your evaluator to work with the states and can be
integrated with your application.
