## Credits:

The implementation inspired by https://github.com/ysmood/nisp[NISP], which does the similar thing in JS. In addition to what 
is supported in NISP, `j-s-exp` provides the support for context, which helps your evaluator to work with the states and can be
integrated with your application, and also lets you use multiple instance of evaluator to be operated in different context.
